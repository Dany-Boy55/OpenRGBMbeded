# OpenRGB embeded
Meant to work in conjuction with the rest of [OpenRGB]("https://github.com/Dany-Boy55/OpenRGB.git"), this project is design to work on arduino and other embeded platforms. 

## Functionality thus far:
- Basic Serial communication with a computer
- light up an addressable WS2812 led strip with a single color
